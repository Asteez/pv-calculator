Project is still in working progress.

This project allows to create both construction and electrical material lists for the PV installations and export it to the file.

I created this project for two reasons - to practice my object oriented programming skills and to use it in my work to improve and speed up creating material lists. Application require input of some basic data about the pv installation, for example pv modules specific data and type of installation, and based on the provided information it creates material lists.

This is console application with no frontend. My main goal is to focus on improving my backend skills, also for my purpose, it is enough to use the console version.
