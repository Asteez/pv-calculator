Project in working progress

This project creates the list of both construction and electrical material for PV installations based on input data (for example construction type, modules power etc.) and export the list to the file.

I created this project for two reasons - to practice my object oriented programming skills and to actually use it in my daily work as an renewable energy engineer. It allowed me to create material lists
way faster. All calculation in the backend of app are supported with my work experience.

This is console application with no frontend. Main reasons to that, is that my goal is to focus on improving my backend skills, also the console version is just enough for my purpose.
