This project creates the list of both construction and electrical material for PV installations based on input data (for example construction type, modules power etc.) and export the list to the excel file.
to the path of your choice.

I created this project for two reasons - to practice my object oriented programming skills and to actually use it in my daily work as an renewable energy engineer. It allowed me to create material lists
way faster. All calculation in the within the app are based on my work experience.

Open app in the CLI, write required data and save data to file. Then check the excel file - generated materials and list of installations are there.
